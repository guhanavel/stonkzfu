# Stonkzfu

Stonkzfu was my first attempt at creating a startup during my year 1 winter break. It was a side hustle project that aimed to provide an interactive dashboard for comprehensive analysis and prediction of SP100 stocks. The project utilized the Dash/Plotly framework to create a user-friendly interface and scraped data from Yahoo Finance and Google News to provide real-time information and news updates. The website was hosted on AWS EC2, and it incorporated an ARIMA time series model to predict future 5-day stock prices.


## Features
Interactive Dashboard: The dashboard provided a comprehensive analysis of SP100 stocks, including visualizations of historical prices, technical indicators, and news sentiment analysis.

Real-time Data: The project scraped data from Yahoo Finance to provide up-to-date stock information, including prices, volumes, market caps, and more.

News Updates: It also fetched news articles from Google News related to the selected stock, allowing users to stay informed about recent developments.

Stock Price Prediction: Utilizing an ARIMA time series model, the project offered predictions of future 5-day stock prices to assist users in making informed investment decisions.

## Usage
To access the Stonkzfu project and explore the interactive dashboard, follow these steps:

Visit the project URL: Stonkzfu

Enter the ticker symbol of the desired SP100 stock in the query parameter. For example, to view Microsoft's analysis and predictions, use the following URL: [Stonkzfu - Microsoft](https://www.stonkzfu.com/das/?val=MSFT)

Explore the interactive dashboard, which provides a range of visualizations, historical data, technical indicators, and news updates for the selected stock.

Check the predicted future 5-day stock prices generated by the ARIMA model to gain insights for potential investment strategies.

Please note that the Stonkzfu website has been taken down due to high maintenance costs, but you can still refer to the project documentation and code for reference or potential further development.
